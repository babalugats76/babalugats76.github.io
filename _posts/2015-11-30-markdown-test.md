This is my first post, I really want to see how it will change the index page, which (right now) is driving me crazy!

Use highlight to see my awesome code snippets code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
