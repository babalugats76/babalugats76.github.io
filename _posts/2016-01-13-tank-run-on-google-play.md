I just released a new game, Tank Run, on Google Play.  Tank Run is a classically-inspired top down tank mini-game in which you race against time and battle pesky enemy tanks while trying to make it back to your post. I use Tank Run as the model mini-game for teaching cross-platform Game Development with Construct 2.
