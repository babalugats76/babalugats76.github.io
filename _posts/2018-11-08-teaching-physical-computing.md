excerpt: Thoughts on FutureLearn's PD Teaching Physical Computing with Raspberry Pi and Python 
---
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't chosen to attend last year's <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/training/picademy/" target="_blank">Picademy</a>.  Instead, I have been working through FutureLearn's <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/physical-computing-raspberry-pi-python" target="_blank">Teaching Physical Computing with Raspberry Pi and Python</a> course.</p>
<p>This 4-week PD is focused on building simple, physical, interactive systems aimed at teaching computing concepts.  The course focuses on the traditional Raspberry Pi and Python 3, but I have been trying to adapt much of the materials to work on the much more cost-friendly Raspberry Pi Zero W.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qaeducation.co.uk/news/physical-computing" target="_blank">This article</a> in QA Education Magazine has the gist from the course authors' perspective.</a> and am documenting the nitty gritty in this <a href="https://github.com/babalugats76/teach-physical-computing" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
