NPR's technology correspondent, <strong>Steve Henn</strong>, recently published a podcast <sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="reference-1">1</a></sup> and follow-up article<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="reference-2">2</a></sup> highlighting the causes for the precipitous drop in the number of women in Computer Science.

Many people are aware that, historically, a large number of the pioneers in the world of computing have been female.  Notably, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" title="Ada Lovelace - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Ada Lovelace</a></strong> wrote the instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)" title="Margaret Hamilton (scientist) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Margaret Hamilton</a></strong> is hailed for not only saving the Apollo 11 Moon landing but also for having coined the term "Software Engineering."  Unfortunately, female interest and influence in the field waned starting in the early 1980s amidst the budding PC revolution.

The article largely attributes the decline of women in computing to parents' aversion to buying PCs for their little girls.  PCs and other such technological innovations have largely been seen as appropriate for young males.  As such, males are much more likely to get a head start in Computer Science, having acquired many more years of experience with a computer at home.
