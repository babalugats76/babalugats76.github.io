        <p>James Colestock, the pride of Fort Wayne, Indiana, now lives and teaches in the Denver Metro area. In 2012, James decided to set aside the corporate world and pursue his long-standing interest in teaching. Shortly thereafter, he completed his student teaching at Abraham Lincoln High School alongside Mr. Jackie McBroom while earning a Master’s degree in Secondary Education, a Colorado teaching license, and multiple CTE (Career and Technical
            Education) endorsements. Since then, he has focused on developing and delivering a comprehensive CTE Information Technology program, most recently at APS Online High School (now called APS Avenues) in Aurora Public Schools.</p>
        <p>Before becoming an educator, James was a proud Mastodon at IPFW – the joint campus of Indiana University and Purdue University in his hometown of Fort Wayne – where he studied Business and Computers, setting him up for a 15-year career as an Oracle
            Database Administrator. He continues to be involved in a variety of technology-related endeavors.</p>
        <p>With his experience in a variety of business and technology settings, James is excited to bring the real world into the classroom and to help students connect what they are learning in their courses to their future plans and ambitions. When he’s
            not working with students in the classroom, James is often found playing his guitar or watching his beloved Chicago Cubs <strike>lose</strike> win!</p>
